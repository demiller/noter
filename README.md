# Noter

A Python script for managing daily notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) with timestamp support.

## Description

Noter is a simple command-line utility designed to help you quickly add timestamped notes to your daily note files in Obsidian. It intelligently integrates with your existing Obsidian templates and adds entries to the "Notes & Observations" section of your daily notes.

The script automatically:
- Creates new daily note files if they don't exist (with full YAML frontmatter)
- Adds timestamped entries to existing daily notes
- Maintains proper spacing and bullet point formatting
- Preserves your existing Obsidian template structure
- Inserts notes in the appropriate section of your daily note

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Windows, macOS, or Linux operating system
- An existing Obsidian vault

## Installation

### Option 1: Run as a Python Script

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/demiller/noter.git
   cd noter
   ```

2. Configure the Obsidian vault path in `noter.py`:
   ```python
   # Configure your Obsidian Vault Path here
   OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH = r"YOUR_OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH\Daily Notes"
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```
   python noter.py
   ```

### Option 2: Use the Executable (Windows Only)

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/demiller/noter/releases).
2. Run `noter.exe`

### Option 3: Compile Your Own Executable

1. Install PyInstaller:
   ```
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. Compile the script:
   ```
   pyinstaller --onefile noter.py
   ```

3. The executable will be created in the `dist` directory.

## Usage

1. Run the script or executable:
   ```
   python noter.py
   ```
   or 
   ```
   .\noter.exe
   ```

2. When prompted, enter the note you want to add:
   ```
   Enter the note you want to append: Had a meeting with the marketing team about Q3 strategy
   ```

3. The note will be added to today's daily note with a timestamp:
   ```
   - [15:42] Had a meeting with the marketing team about Q3 strategy
   ```

## Features

- **Automatic Timestamping**: Each note is automatically prefixed with the current time in `[HH:MM]` format.
- **Daily Organization**: Notes are organized by date in individual daily note files (YYYY-MM-DD.md).
- **YAML Frontmatter**: Automatically adds complete YAML frontmatter for new notes.
- **Template Compatible**: Works with your existing Obsidian daily note templates.
- **Section Awareness**: Intelligently adds notes to the "Notes & Observations" section.
- **Smart Formatting**: 
  - Adds notes directly after existing bullets without extra spacing
  - Only adds empty bullets in empty sections
  - Maintains clean formatting between notes
- **Simple Interface**: Minimalist command-line interface for quick note capture.

## Configuration

The main configuration is the path to your Obsidian vault's Daily Notes folder. You can modify this in the `noter.py` file:

```python
# Configure your Obsidian Vault Path here
OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH = r"C:\Users\DougMiller\OneDrive - Brightworks Group, LLC\Obsidian_Vault\Daily Notes"
```

Replace this with the path to your own Obsidian vault's Daily Notes folder.

## Daily Note Format

The script creates and works with daily note files following this structure:

```markdown
---
title: "Daily Note - YYYY-MM-DD"
status: active
topic: daily-log
reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD
priority: 3
created: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [dailynotes, log]
aliases: []
---

# üìÖÔ∏è Weekday, Month DDth YYYY

## ‚òÄÔ∏è Summary

> What happened today? What did you think about? What patterns or themes emerged?
- 

## ‚úÖ Tasks

- 

## üîÅ Reviews or Highlights Revisited

\```dataview
list
from ""
where reviewed <= date(today) - dur(30 days)
sort reviewed asc
limit 5
\```

## üìì Notes Created or Touched Today

\```dataview
table file.name, file.mtime
from ""
where file.mtime >= date(today)
sort file.mtime desc
\```

## ‚úçÔ∏è Notes & Observations

- [HH:MM] Your note content here
- 
```

The script will:
1. Create this complete structure if the file doesn't exist
2. Find the "## ‚úçÔ∏è Notes & Observations" section
3. Add new notes after any existing notes
4. Add an empty bullet only when the section is empty
5. Preserve proper spacing between notes
6. Maintain all other content in the file

## Note Insertion Rules

The script follows these rules when adding notes:

1. **New File**: Creates a complete template with YAML frontmatter and all sections
2. **Empty Section**: Adds the note followed by an empty bullet
3. **Existing Notes**: 
   - Adds the new note directly after the last existing note
   - Maintains single-line spacing between notes
   - Does not add empty bullets after existing content
4. **Formatting**: Always maintains proper spacing and bullet point structure
